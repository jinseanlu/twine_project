Panel 5:
You should know since you&#39;re so good at math. Poisounous Gas gets released and security beat you up. You&#39;re already dead, so it doesn&#39;t matter
Panel 4:
You manage to access the lab. You finally made a teleporter, and haven&#39;t eaten for a day. You find a hamburger and eat it. Yum Yum Yum. The teleporter is ready to be tested. You started out. You finally test the teleporter. You don&#39;t know what happened, but you were sent back to the era where there were dinosaurs. What should you do?
